# word-guesser-word-game
its is a word game using python I specifically made it so its easier to understand.

Here I have used a list and imported the random library for choosing the word from the list . After choosing the word the index of the word are replaced with "_". Then there are some if else lines and a function for checking the value of i ehich when reaches 5 stops / ends the game.
